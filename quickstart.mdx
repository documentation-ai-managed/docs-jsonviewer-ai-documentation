description: Learn how to quickly access and use JSON Viewer to handle your first JSON file in minutes.

## Get started in minutes

JSON Viewer provides a free online tool at `jsonviewer.ai` to view, validate, and beautify your JSON data. You can handle complex data structures in your browser without installing any software.

JSON is a common text format that apps and websites use to store and send data, such as settings, reports, or API responses. Inspecting JSON helps you see exactly what data is being sent or stored so you can understand, debug, or share it more easily.

Follow these steps to process your first JSON file.

    Copy your JSON and paste it directly into the main text area.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Copy JSON">
        Select some realistic data, such as this API response example.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Paste data">
        ```json
        {"user":{"id":123,"name":"Jane Doe","email":"jane@example.com","orders":[{"id":456,"total":29.99},{"id":789,"total":15.50}]}}
        ```
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Upload file" icon="upload">
    Drag and drop or select a `.json` file from your computer.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Prepare file">
        Save your JSON data to a file named `data.json` (or any name ending in `.json`).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Upload">
        Drag the file into the upload area or click `Choose File` and select your JSON file.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Explore the interface

After your JSON loads, explore these core features:

<ExpandableGroup>
  <Expandable title="Tree view" default-open="true">
    Expand and collapse nested objects to see the structure of your data. Click the arrows to drill into arrays and objects, such as a `user` object or an `orders` list.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Validation">
    The tool highlights syntax errors in red. This helps you spot issues such as missing commas, extra quotes, or invalid values so you can fix them quickly.
  </Expandable>
  <Expandable title="Beautify">
    Click `Beautify` to format minified JSON into a clean, indented layout that is easier to read and understand.
  </Expandable>
</ExpandableGroup>

<CodeGroup tabs="Minified,Beautified">
  ```json
  {"user":{"id":123,"name":"Jane Doe","email":"jane@example.com","orders":[{"id":456,"total":29.99},{"id":789,"total":15.50}]}}
  ```
  ```json
  {
    "user": {
      "id": 123,
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "email": "jane@example.com",
      "orders": [
        {
          "id": 456,
          "total": 29.99
        },
        {
          "id": 789,
          "total": 15.50
        }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Callout kind="success">
  Your JSON now displays with syntax highlighting, making nested objects and arrays easy to scan.
</Callout>

## Troubleshooting your first JSON

If something does not look right when you load your JSON, try these quick checks:

- **Red error highlight or message**  
  Your JSON is likely missing a comma, quote, or brace. Scroll to the highlighted line, compare with the examples above, and fix the typo. If you copied from a website, make sure you did not include extra text like comments or HTML.

- **Nothing appears in the tree view**  
  Confirm that the text area is not empty and that what you pasted is valid JSON, not plain text or another format (for example, CSV). If your data starts with `(` or has `=` before it, remove that extra text and try again.

- **File feels too large or slow to load**  
  Very large JSON files can be slow to display in a browser. Try trimming the file to a smaller part, such as a single object or page of results, then reload that portion to inspect it.

- **I am not sure if my data is safe to paste**  
  JSON Viewer runs entirely in your browser and does not send your data to a server, but you should still avoid sharing sensitive data with other people. Remove or mask private details such as passwords or personal identifiers before saving or sharing.

## Next steps

Once your JSON looks correct, you can:

- Copy the formatted JSON directly from the viewer.
- Download it as a cleaned-up `.json` file for later use.
- Share the formatted JSON with teammates or use it in your own tools.
