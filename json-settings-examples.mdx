description: Practical JSON configuration examples for app settings, feature flags, environments, and logging, plus how to inspect them with JSON Viewer.
---

## Overview

This page gives you copy-pasteable JSON configuration examples you can load into JSON Viewer to understand and validate common patterns:

- Basic app settings
- Feature flags
- Environment-specific overrides
- Logging levels and modules

Use these examples as starting points for your own applications and services.

<Callout kind="info">

All examples below are valid JSON. Comments and explanations appear in the surrounding text, not inside the JSON, so you can paste them directly into JSON Viewer.

</Callout>

## Using JSON Viewer with configuration files

You can load any of the examples in two ways:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Paste JSON" icon="clipboard">

    1. Copy a JSON example from this page.  
    2. Open JSON Viewer.  
    3. Paste into the main text area.  
    4. Inspect the tree view to see sections like `app`, `features`, or `logging`.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Upload file" icon="upload">

    1. Save one of the examples to a file such as `config.json`.  
    2. In JSON Viewer, use the upload area or `Choose File`.  
    3. Browse the parsed tree and use error messages if the file is not valid JSON.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout kind="tip">

If JSON Viewer shows a parse error, check for trailing commas, missing quotes, or mismatched braces. Fix the file and reload to confirm it parses correctly before deploying.

</Callout>

## Example 1: Basic application settings

This configuration captures app-level settings you might share across all environments.

```json
{
  "app": {
    "name": "Acme Dashboard",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "defaultLocale": "en-US",
    "supportedLocales": ["en-US", "fr-FR", "de-DE"]
  },
  "server": {
    "port": 3000,
    "baseUrl": "https://dashboard.example.com",
    "sessionTimeoutSeconds": 3600
  },
  "security": {
    "enableHttps": true,
    "allowedOrigins": ["https://dashboard.example.com"],
    "csrfProtection": true
  }
}
```

### What to inspect in JSON Viewer

- Expand the `app` node to verify name, version, and locale settings.
- Expand `server` to review port and base URL.
- Check `security` to confirm cross-origin and HTTPS-related settings.

When you edit values (for example, change the port or add locales), paste the updated JSON back into JSON Viewer to ensure it still parses correctly.

## Example 2: Feature flags

Feature flags let you enable or disable parts of your app without redeploying code.

```json
{
  "features": {
    "newOnboardingFlow": {
      "enabled": false,
      "description": "Gradually roll out the redesigned onboarding experience.",
      "rolloutPercentage": 0
    },
    "betaReporting": {
      "enabled": true,
      "description": "Enables experimental reports for internal users.",
      "allowedRoles": ["admin", "analyst"]
    },
    "maintenanceMode": {
      "enabled": false,
      "message": "The system is undergoing maintenance. Please try again later."
    }
  }
}
```

### What to inspect in JSON Viewer

- Verify that each feature under `features` has:
  - An `enabled` boolean.
  - Optional metadata like `description` and `allowedRoles`.
- Use the tree to quickly scan which features are on or off.
- If you add a new feature flag, reload the JSON and confirm it appears in the `features` object with the expected structure.

<Callout kind="tip">

Use JSON Viewer search to quickly find a specific feature name, such as `newOnboardingFlow`, when your configuration grows large.

</Callout>

## Example 3: Base config plus environment overrides

A common pattern is to have a shared `base` configuration and per-environment overrides such as `development`, `staging`, and `production`.

Here is a single JSON file that contains both the base settings and overrides:

```json
{
  "base": {
    "app": {
      "name": "Acme API",
      "defaultLocale": "en-US"
    },
    "api": {
      "requestTimeoutMs": 5000,
      "retryAttempts": 2
    },
    "logging": {
      "level": "info",
      "format": "json"
    }
  },
  "environments": {
    "development": {
      "api": {
        "baseUrl": "http://localhost:4000",
        "requestTimeoutMs": 10000
      },
      "logging": {
        "level": "debug"
      }
    },
    "staging": {
      "api": {
        "baseUrl": "https://staging-api.example.com"
      },
      "logging": {
        "level": "info"
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "api": {
        "baseUrl": "https://api.example.com",
        "retryAttempts": 3
      },
      "logging": {
        "level": "warn"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### How to read this in JSON Viewer

1. Expand `base` to understand the defaults that apply to all environments.
2. Expand `environments.development`, `environments.staging`, and `environments.production` to see differences:
   - `base.api.requestTimeoutMs` is `5000`, but `development` overrides it to `10000`.
   - `base.logging.level` is `info`, but `production` uses `warn` to reduce log volume.
3. Use the tree to compare effective values for each environment without scrolling through a long flat document.

<Callout kind="info">

JSON itself does not automatically merge `base` and `environments`. Your application code or configuration loader must implement the merge behavior. JSON Viewer helps you inspect both base values and overrides to confirm they are defined as expected.

</Callout>

## Example 4: Split files for base and environment

Another common pattern is to keep base configuration and overrides in separate files. JSON Viewer can help you inspect each file independently.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="base.json" icon="file-text">

    ```json
    {
      "app": {
        "name": "Acme Frontend",
        "defaultLocale": "en-US",
        "enableTracking": true
      },
      "api": {
        "baseUrl": "https://api.example.com",
        "requestTimeoutMs": 8000
      },
      "logging": {
        "level": "info",
        "format": "text"
      }
    }
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="config.development.json" icon="settings">

    ```json
    {
      "api": {
        "baseUrl": "http://localhost:5000",
        "requestTimeoutMs": 15000
      },
      "logging": {
        "level": "debug"
      },
      "app": {
        "enableTracking": false
      }
    }
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### How to use this pattern with JSON Viewer

1. Load `base.json` in JSON Viewer:
   - Confirm core keys like `app`, `api`, and `logging` exist.
   - Review default values for tracking and logging.

2. Load `config.development.json`:
   - Check which values are overridden, such as `api.baseUrl` and `logging.level`.
   - Ensure overrides only contain keys your app expects.

3. In your app, merge `base.json` with `config.development.json` (logic in your code or build system). Use JSON Viewer to verify each file is valid JSON and has the expected structure before merging.

## Example 5: Logging configuration by module

Logging configuration often includes levels per module or namespace.

```json
{
  "logging": {
    "defaultLevel": "info",
    "format": "json",
    "timestamp": true,
    "outputs": [
      {
        "type": "console",
        "level": "debug"
      },
      {
        "type": "file",
        "level": "info",
        "filePath": "/var/log/acme-app.log",
        "maxSizeMb": 100,
        "maxFiles": 5
      }
    ],
    "modules": {
      "http": {
        "level": "warn"
      },
      "database": {
        "level": "error",
        "slowQueryThresholdMs": 500
      },
      "auth": {
        "level": "debug"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### What to inspect in JSON Viewer

- Expand `logging.outputs` to verify console and file output definitions.
- Check `logging.modules` to confirm each subsystem has the right `level`.
- When you add new modules or outputs, reload into JSON Viewer to ensure the array and object structures remain valid.

<Callout kind="tip">

Use JSON Viewer&apos;s tree view to quickly see which modules are set to noisy levels like `debug` so you can adjust them before deploying to production.

</Callout>

## Example 6: Third-party integration settings

Integrations often require multiple URLs, timeouts, and credentials.

```json
{
  "integrations": {
    "paymentProvider": {
      "enabled": true,
      "baseUrl": "https://payments.example-pay.com",
      "apiKey": "env:PAYMENT_PROVIDER_API_KEY",
      "timeoutMs": 7000,
      "retryAttempts": 3
    },
    "emailService": {
      "enabled": true,
      "baseUrl": "https://api.mailer.example",
      "apiKey": "env:EMAIL_API_KEY",
      "timeoutMs": 5000,
      "defaultFromAddress": "no-reply@example.com"
    },
    "analytics": {
      "enabled": false,
      "provider": "ExampleAnalytics",
      "trackingId": "env:ANALYTICS_TRACKING_ID"
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, sensitive values like `apiKey` and `trackingId` reference environment variables using a simple `env:` prefix.

### How JSON Viewer helps here

- Expand `integrations` to confirm each service is present and `enabled` as expected.
- Scan for hard-coded secrets. If your config accidentally contains real keys, JSON Viewer makes them easy to spot so you can move them to environment variables instead.
- Validate new integrations by pasting updated JSON and checking for parsing errors or missing required fields.
