## Overview

JSON Viewer helps you view, validate, beautify, and export JSON data efficiently. Paste your JSON into the editor to explore nested structures, catch syntax errors, format for readability, and download results in multiple formats. This guide walks you through each core feature.

JSON is a simple text format that stores data as pairs of names and values, such as a user name or a list of items. Many apps, websites, and APIs use JSON to send and receive data.

## Viewing and navigating JSON structures

Access the viewer at [jsonviewer.ai](https://jsonviewer.ai). Paste your JSON to start.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Paste JSON" icon="clipboard">
    Enter your data in the left panel. For example:
    
    <CodeGroup tabs="Minified,Pretty">
    ```json
    {"user":{"name":"Alice","age":30,"orders":[{"id":1,"item":"Book"},{"id":2,"item":"Laptop"}]}}
    ```
    ```json
    {
      "user": {
        "name": "Alice",
        "age": 30,
        "orders": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "item": "Book"
          },
          {
            "id": 2,
            "item": "Laptop"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate tree" icon="git-branch">
    Click arrows to expand `objects` or `arrays`. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (or your browser search) to find keys like `user.name`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy path" icon="copy">
    Right-click any value to copy its JSON path, for example `user.orders[0].id`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use the tree view for complex nested data. Hover over values to see helpful tooltips with types such as `string` or `number`.
</Callout>

## Validating JSON for errors

Ensure your JSON is syntactically correct before you use or share it.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Valid JSON" icon="check-circle">
    Paste clean data:
    
    ```json
    {
      "apiResponse": {
        "status": "success",
        "data": ["item1", "item2"]
      }
    }
    ```
    
    The viewer highlights valid JSON in green.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Invalid JSON" icon="x-circle">
    Try malformed input:
    
    ```json
    {
      "key": "value"
    "missing comma"
    }
    ```
    
    Errors appear in red with line numbers and hints on what to fix.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout kind="alert">
  Always validate large API responses. Common issues include trailing commas, missing commas, or keys that are not wrapped in quotes.
</Callout>

## Beautifying and formatting JSON

Transform minified JSON into a readable format.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Auto-beautify" icon="magic">
    Paste minified JSON. Click "Beautify" to add indentation and line breaks for easier reading.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Customize" icon="settings">
    Adjust indent size (2 or 4 spaces) and toggle options such as always showing quotes for keys.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Example transformation:

````json
Minified: {"config":{"theme":"dark","features":["search","export"]}}
````

Beautified:

```json
{
  "config": {
    "theme": "dark",
    "features": [
      "search",
      "export"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Exporting results

Save your processed JSON easily.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Download JSON" icon="download">
    Click "Download JSON" to save your data as a `.json` file.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Copy formatted" icon="copy">
    Select "Copy to Clipboard" to copy the beautified version and paste it into another tool.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Convert to CSV" icon="table">
    For flat arrays, export as CSV:
    
    | id | name   | age |
    |----|--------|-----|
    | 1  | Alice  | 30  |
    | 2  | Bob    | 25  |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Best practices

- When working with very large JSON files, start with a smaller sample so the viewer stays fast and easy to use.
- Avoid pasting sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, or personal details. If you must work with real data, mask or change those values first.
- Validate often while you edit. Make a small change, validate, then continue. This makes it easier to find what broke the JSON.
- Use clear, realistic example data (for example, real-looking names, emails, and product names) so teammates can understand structures at a glance.
- Keep a copy of the original JSON when you experiment, so you can quickly go back if something goes wrong.
- When sharing screenshots or snippets, remove or blur anything private or confidential.

<Expandable title="Advanced Export Tips" default-open="false">
  Use browser extensions for bulk exports. For APIs, pipe responses directly via `curl | beautify`.
