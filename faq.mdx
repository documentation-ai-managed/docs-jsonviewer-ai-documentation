This page answers common questions about using JSON Viewer. If you are just getting started, see the [Quick Start](/quickstart) and [User Guide](/guide) for step-by-step help.

## Common usage issues

JSON Viewer handles most JSON data smoothly, but you might see parsing errors if the input is broken or the file is very large. Follow these steps to troubleshoot.

If this is your first time loading JSON, see **Troubleshooting your first JSON** in the [Quick Start](/quickstart) for a guided walkthrough.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Paste or upload JSON" icon="upload">

    Copy your JSON data and paste it into the editor, or upload a `.json` file. Try to avoid trailing commas or unescaped quotes, as these can cause errors.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Check for errors" icon="alert-triangle">

    Look for red highlights that show where the syntax issue is. Common problems include missing brackets, missing commas, or invalid values.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate and beautify" icon="check-circle">

    Click **Validate** to scan for errors. Use **Beautify** to clean up the spacing and indentation so the JSON is easier to read.

```json

  "user": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "Jane Doe",
    "email": "jane@example.com",
    "orders": ["item1", "item2"]
  }
}
```
```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane@example.com"  // Missing closing brace
}
```

<Callout kind="tip">

  For files larger than `10MB`, try splitting them into smaller parts or use desktop tools like VS Code with JSON extensions.

## Data privacy and security

JSON Viewer processes your JSON directly in your browser. Your data is not sent to a server, and it is not stored or logged by the site.

<Callout kind="info">

  No data leaves your device. Validation and beautification happen locally using JavaScript in your browser, so your information stays with you.

</Callout>

<Callout kind="success">

  This means you can safely view sensitive data, like API responses or user profiles. When you are done, clear the editor or refresh the page to remove the content from your screen.

</Callout>

## Tool limitations and alternatives

JSON Viewer is designed for quick viewing and validation of JSON in your browser. It has some limits on file size and does not include full editing features.

| Limitation | Details | Workaround |
|------------|---------|------------|
| File Size | Up to 10MB | Split large JSON or use local tools |
| No Editing | View-only | Copy beautified JSON to an editor |
| Browser-Only | No desktop app | Use extensions or CLI tools |
